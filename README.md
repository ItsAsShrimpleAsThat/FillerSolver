# Filler Solver
### (i know the html/css is bad, this is my second time using it lol)

Engine/solver for my favorite game on [GamePigeon](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gamepigeon/id1124197642).

I made this because I used to be the best in my friend group at this game, but recently, one of my friends got better than me at it, so I made this so I can beat them.

# How to use
There are 2 modes: <b>Search mode</b> and <b>Solve mode</b>.

<b>Search mode</b> operates a lot like a chess engine, such as Stockfish. In this mode, the solver will only search to a certain depth + some additional depth until the search has found quiescence <b>(if enabled)</b>. Many additional options are available in this mode.

<b>Solve mode</b> will fully solve the game. It will search every single possible position in the game, which will take much longer than Search mode.

Details about how to use each mode are provided below.
